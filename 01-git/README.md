# Git and GitHub Overview

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system. It helps you track changes to files over time, so you can recall specific versions later. Git is particularly useful for developers, as it allows multiple people to collaborate on a project without overwriting each other's work.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git for version control. It allows you to store your Git repositories online, making it easier to share your code with others, collaborate on projects, and even showcase your work.

## Why Do You Need Git and GitHub?

- **Track Changes:** Git keeps a history of every change made to your files, making it easy to revert to previous versions.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.
- **Backup:** Your code is safely stored online with GitHub, so you donâ€™t have to worry about losing your work.
- **Showcase:** GitHub is like a portfolio for developers. You can share your projects and contributions publicly.
